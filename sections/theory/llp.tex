\subsubsection{The idea}
The idea of the $\LLP(q, k)$ grammar class comes from wanting to create an $\LL(k)$ like grammar class which can be parsed in parallel. To describe how this is done a definition for a given state during $\LL(k)$ parsing is needed.

\begin{definition}[Production sequence]
    \label{def:production-sequence}
    Let $G = (N, T, P, S)$ be a context-free grammar where each production $p_i \in P$ is assigned a unique integer $i \in \{0, ..., |P| - 1\} = \mathcal{I}$. Then the set of every valid and invalid sequence of productions $\mathcal{S}$\footnote{It is chosen to use a squence for the ``prefix of  a left parse'' \cite[5]{Vagner2007} because it seemed like a better choice then the grammar notation.} is given by.
    \begin{align*}
        \mathcal{S} = \{(a_k)_{k=0}^n : n \in \mathbb{N}, a_k \in \mathcal{I}\}
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[LL parser configuration]
    \label{def:ll-configuration}
    Let $G = (N, T, P, S)$ be a context-free grammar that is an $\LL(k)$ grammar for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}_+$. A given configuration \cite[p. 5]{Vagner2007} of a $\LL(k)$ parser is then given by.
    \begin{align*}
        (w, \alpha, \pi) \in T^* \times (T \cup N)^* \times \mathcal{S}
    \end{align*}
    For a $\LL(k)$ parser configuration $(w, \alpha, \pi)$ would $w$ denote the input string, $\alpha$ denote the push down store and $\pi$ denote the sequence of rules used to derive the consumed input string.
\end{definition}
\noindent When using deterministic $\LL(k)$ parsing you want to create a parsing function $\phi: T^* \to \mathcal{S}$ for a grammar $G = (N, T, P, S)$. This parser function is a function which is able to create the production sequence as defined by the relation $\vdash^*$ \cite[6]{Vagner2007}.
\begin{align*}
    \phi(w) = \pi \text{ where } (w, S, (\;)) \vdash^* (\epsilon, \epsilon, \pi) 
\end{align*}
If the $\vdash^*$ relation does not hold then $w$ can not be parsed. 

The concept of deterministic $\LLP(q,k)$ parsing is if a string $w \in T^*$ is going to be parsed then construct every pair such that.
\begin{align*}
    M =&\; \{((x, y), i) : w = \delta xy_i \beta, |x| = q, |y_i| = k\} \\
    \cup&\; \{((x, y), i) : w = xy_i \beta, |x| \leq q, |y| = k\} \\
    \cup&\; \{((x, y), i) : w = \delta xy_i, |x| = q, |y| \leq k\}
\end{align*}
Where $i \in \mathbb{N}$ denotes the index of where the start of the substring $y_i$ such the ordering can be kept. Then we would want to create table lookup function $\Phi: T^* \times T^* \to (T \cup N)^* \times (T \cup N)^* \times \mathcal{S}$. This function maps the pairs $(x,y)$ to a triplet $(\omega, \alpha, \pi)$ which is much the same as the configuration described in definition \ref{def:ll-configuration}. 
\begin{definition}[LLP parser configuration]
    \label{def:llp-configuration}
    Let $G = (N, T, P, S)$ be a context-free grammar that is a $\LLP(q, k)$ grammar for some $q, k \in \mathbb{Z}_+$. Let $(x, y)$ be a pair such that $xy$ occurs as a substring in $\mathcal{L}(G)$, $x \in T^{*q}$, $y \in T^{*k}$. If $\PSLS(x,y) = \{\omega\}$ the pair $(x, y)$ has the following LLP configuration.
    \begin{align*}
        (\omega, \alpha, \pi) \in (T \cup N)^* \times (T \cup N)^* \times \mathcal{S}
    \end{align*}
    Where $\omega$ is the initial push down store, $\alpha$ is the final push down store after parsing $(y, \omega, (\;)) = (vw, \omega, (\;)) \vdash^* (w, \alpha, \pi)$, $v \in T$ and $w \in T^*$ and $\pi$ are the resulting productions.
\end{definition}
\noindent After all the $x, y$ pairs have been constructed they are glued together to determined if the resulting triplet is $(S, \epsilon, \pi)$ meaning the input was parsable. This is described in detail in the LLP paper \cite[7]{Vagner2007}, but this description will be helpful for the rest of the paper.

\subsubsection{Determining if a grammar is LLP}
When dealing with a $\LL(k)$ parser a common answer to if the grammar is a $\LL(k)$ parser is: if the parser table can be constructed then it is a $\LL(k)$ grammar. The same goes for $\LLP(q,k)$ grammars, that is a grammar is a $\LLP(q,k)$ if the $\LLP(q, k)$ table can be constructed.

The first step in determining if a grammar is a $\LLP(q,k)$ grammar is if it is in the LL grammar class. This is because the LLP parser uses the LL parser to construct the table, therefore the class suffers from the same limitations. The next step is to determine if the $(x, y)$ pair leads to multiple $(\omega, \alpha, \pi)$ LLP configurations. This is what definition 10 \cite[13]{Vagner2007} is used for, to determine if the grammar is LLP.

Definition 10 \cite[13]{Vagner2007} uses the $\PSLS(x, y)$ \cite[12]{Vagner2007} values to determine the initial push down stores which can be used to determine final push down store in the LLP configuration $(\omega, \alpha, \pi)$. The trouble is when working with LLP grammars the $\PSLS(x, y)$ definition can be troublesome to use to understand if a grammar is $\LLP(q, k)$.


\begin{example}
    Let $(\{A, B\}, \{a, b\}, P, A)$ be a context free grammar where $P$ is.
    \begin{gather*}
        A \to a b b B \qquad B \to b \qquad B \to A
    \end{gather*}
    The initial push down store for the admissible pair $(b, b)$ is $\PSLS(b, b) = \{b, B\}$. Therefore, this grammar is not $\LLP(1, 1)$, but it is $\LLP(2, 1)$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Let $(\{S\}, \{[, ]\}, P, S)$ be a context free grammar where $P$ is.
    \begin{gather*}
        S \to [S] \qquad S \to \epsilon
    \end{gather*}
    This grammar seems like it is not $\LLP(q, k)$ for any $q, k \geq 1$ because for any pairs $([^q, [^k)$ can lead to a LL configuration $(]^n, S]^n, \pi)$ where $q + k \leq n$. This grammar is actually a $\LLP(1,1)$ grammar because the LLP parser uses the shortest prefix of the initial push down store when performing the gluing the LLP configuration. The LLP configuration for $([^q, [^k)$ would then be $(S, S], \pi)$ because $S$ is the initial push down store and $S]$ is the final push down store after parsing expanding $S$ and popping $[$.
\end{example}


\begin{example}
    Let $(\{S\}, \{a\}, P, S)$ be a context free grammar where $P$ is.
    \begin{gather*}
        S \to aaS \qquad S \to \epsilon
    \end{gather*}
    This grammar is mentioned in the LLP paper \cite[16]{Vagner2007} as a grammar that is not $\LLP(q,k)$ for any $q, k \in \mathbb{Z}_+$. This is because pair $(a^q, a^k)$ could lead to the possible initial push down stores is $\PSLS(a^q, a^k) = \{a, S\}$. If the productions for the grammar were.
    \begin{gather*}
        S \to aS \qquad S \to \epsilon
    \end{gather*}
    Then the grammar is $\LLP(1, 1)$ because now only $\PSLS(a^q, a^k) = \{S\}$ only can occur.
\end{example}
