The algorithms related to parsing and constructions of $LLP(q, k)$ are tested. Some precomputed examples from the LLP paper \cite{Vagner2007} are used to test that each algorithm arrives at the correct result. This is because there is not really any easy way of implementing the PSLS definition. The second problem is computing the LLP Item collection by hand would be quite a daunting task. Therefore the LLP collection in example 11. \cite[14]{Vagner2007} is used to assert correctness and the PSLS table in example 12. \cite[14]{Vagner2007}
