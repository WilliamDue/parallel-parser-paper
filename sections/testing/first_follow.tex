To test that the first and follow set are computed correctly using Algorithm \ref{algorithm:first} and \ref{algorithm:follow}, two kinds of testing methods are employed. The first testing method is simply by using some small cases of examples of existing precomputed first and follow sets. Existing results were taken from \cite[58, 62, 63, 65]{Mogensen} with some small modifications to the results where $\epsilon$ is included in the first and follow sets due to the LLP paper definition \cite[5]{Vagner2007}. The last kind of test is done using property based testing but only for the two grammars \cite[62, 63]{Mogensen}. The property tested for is if the functions can reconstruct the LLP paper definition of first and follow \cite[5]{Vagner2007}.
\begin{align*}
    \FIRST_k(\alpha) &= \{x : x \in T^* : \alpha \Rightarrow^* x \beta \land |x| = k\} \\ 
    \, &\cup \{x : x \in T^* : \alpha \Rightarrow^* x \land |x| \leq k\} \\
    \FOLLOW_k(A) &= \{x : x \in T^* : S \Rightarrow^* \alpha A \beta \land x \in \FIRST_k(\beta)\}
\end{align*}
The $\FIRST_k$ definition can be naively implemented by doing a breadth first search on derivable strings for each nonterminal of a grammar. If all nonterminals first sets are reproducible by algorithm \ref{algorithm:first} then the $\FIRST_k$ function is computed correctly for the given grammar.

The $\FOLLOW_k$ definition can also be naively implemented by doing a breadth first search on derivable strings from the starting nonterminal. Every time a nonterminal $A$ occurs in the derivable string the $\FIRST_k$ function is computed of the trailing symbols $\beta$. These sets are then used to construct the $\FOLLOW_k(A)$ set. If all $\FOLLOW_k(A)$ are reproducible algorithm \ref{algorithm:follow} then the $\FOLLOW_k$ function is computed correctly for the given grammar.

For the property based tests $k \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ is used for the two grammars because the naive first and follow implementations becomes extremely slow for larger $k$.

All of these tests was passed. It is assumed that the naive implementations are correct due to their simplicity, therefore Algorithm \ref{algorithm:first} and \ref{algorithm:follow} works as intended.
