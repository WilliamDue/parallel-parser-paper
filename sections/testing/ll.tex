To test the $\LL(k)$ parser, integration tests with some property based like testing is used, since once again these tests are not random. The integration testing comes in the form of ensuring that a working parser is created from the first and follow sets.

One of the integration tests are creating $\LL(k)$ parsers with $k \in \{1, \dots, 5\}$ for a grammar \cite[45]{Mogensen}. Then a parsable string is parsed with a known production sequence. This is done to check if the parser can parse strings correctly. This is the only test done which check for a correct sequence. A better test would have been to compute the sequence order of every derivable string and see if the parser produces the same sequence. This was never done because it was not believed this kind of testing was needed at the time.

The property based like test only checks for if every leftmost derivable string of a given length will result in a sequence. And every string that is not left most derivable will result in an error.
