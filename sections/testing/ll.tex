To test the $\LL(k)$ parser, integration tests with some property based like testing is used, since once again these tests are not random. The integration testing comes in the form of ensuring that when using the first and follow-set functions result in a parser that can give the correct sequence of productions.

One of the integration tests are creating $\LL(k)$ parsers with $k \in \{1, \dots, 5\}$ for a grammar \cite[45]{Mogensen} found in ``Introduction to Compiler Design''. Then a parsable string is parsed with a known production sequence. This is done to check if the parser can parse strings correctly. This is the only test done which check for correct sequences. A better test would have been to compute the sequence order of every derivable string and see if the parser produces the same sequence.

The property based test only checks for if every leftmost derivable string of a given length will result in a sequence. And every string that is not left most derivable will result in an error.
